#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tests/fm-timeout-lib.test.sh - the exit-status contract of the shared bounded
# runner (bin/fm-timeout-lib.sh), including its local mods registered in
# MODS.md.
#
# Every caller in bin/ decides whether a bounded command succeeded by reading
# fm_run_timed's status, and bin/fm-spawn.sh's setup hook refuses a spawn on
# that status alone, so the four mechanisms have to agree on what failure looks
# like. These cases drive the real runner against real child processes and
# assert the status it reports: a normal exit survives, a signal death is
# nonzero (128 + signal, the shell convention), and the bound still reports 124.
#
# Each case runs under all four mechanisms - timeout, gtimeout, perl, bash -
# forced explicitly one at a time, so a CI host with GNU timeout still exercises
# the perl fallback a coreutils-less machine actually uses, and a stock Mac
# still exercises the timeout path CI runs on. A mechanism whose tool this host
# does not have is reported as an explicit skip rather than passed over.
